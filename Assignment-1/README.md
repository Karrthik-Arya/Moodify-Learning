# Virus Spread Simulation
In this project I Have created a model that simulates spread of a virus in 15,000 people starting from just 1 person having a virus. It also takes into account travelling of people by swapping 8 people in each iteration. It considers that first neghbours to the people infected have a 25% cance of infection and 2nd neighbours have 8% chance. It considers the 15000 people as a matrix of 1s and 0s where 1s reperesnt the people that got infected while 0 represents the healthy people. It returns the maximum no. of 1s added in a single iteration and the plots of the total 1s after each iteration and no. of 1s added in each iteration.
