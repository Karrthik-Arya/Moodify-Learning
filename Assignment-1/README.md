# Virus Spread Simulation
In this project I Have created a model that simulates spread of a virus in 15,000 people starting from just 1 person having a virus. It also takes into account travelling of people by swapping 8 people in each iteration. It considers that first neghbours to the people infected have a 25% cance of infection and 2nd neighbours have 8% chance. It considers the 15000 people as a matrix of 1s and 0s where 1s reperesnt the people that got infected while 0 represents the healthy people. It returns the maximum no. of 1s added in a single iteration and the plots of the total 1s after each iteration and no. of 1s added in each iteration.
In this I have first created a function to swap 8 random elements in the matrix which is executed in each iteration. Then the program iterates through the whole matrix and adds the position of elements which are ones in another array. Then for each of those elements I run two functions which respectively modify the first and second neighbours. I have used the random.choices() function to modify the elements according to the given probabilities.  I store the no. of 1s present and added after each iteration in 2 different arrays which I plot using matplotlib. Here are the plots returned in one instance.

After plotting the function also returns the maximum value of 1s added among all the iterations.
